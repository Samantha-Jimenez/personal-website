<span className="font-normal">I’ve decided to give myself six months to change my life,</span> and I’m bringing you along for the ride.

Starting <strong>July 1st</strong>, I’m launching a new YouTube vlog series called <em>6 Months to Change My Life</em>. Each month, I’ll document my journey across four pillars I’m focused on leveling up: <strong>Career, Fitness, Hobbies, and Aesthetics</strong>. The first two are more structured and goal-oriented, while the latter two lean into creativity, play, and healing.

## The Four Pillars of My 6-Month Reset

### 1. Career
<div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row gap-4 sm:gap-8 items-start">
  <div className="flex-1">
    This is where I’m putting the most energy. I’m currently job hunting in tech and will be sharing the full experience — from tracking applications and prepping for interviews to navigating rejection, imposter syndrome, and the mental side of staying consistent even when things feel slow.

### 2. Fitness — Body Recomp, Strength & Running
<div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row gap-4 sm:gap-8 items-start">
  <div className="flex-1">
    My goal is body recomposition. That means strength training, outdoor runs, and trying new movement styles that bring me joy. I’m also committing to my flexibility era — splits included.

### 3. Hobbies
<div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row gap-4 sm:gap-8 items-start">
  <div className="flex-1">
    At least four days a week, I’ll carve out 30+ minutes for hobbies like:
    - Reading (finally finishing those half-read books)
    - Baking or cooking something new
    - Crocheting
    - Rollerblading & biking (bonus: it fits fitness too!)
    
    This is my reminder that life isn’t just about productivity — it’s about being a full human.

### 4. Aesthetics — Beauty, Style & Experimentation
<div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row gap-4 sm:gap-8 items-start">
  <div className="flex-1">
    Each week, I’ll style 3–4 pieces from my closet I’ve been neglecting — shoes, accessories, statement outfits I’ve been “saving for the right moment.” I’ll also experiment with 2–3 new makeup or hair looks weekly to keep things fresh and fun.

## Why I’m Documenting This

Yes, I want to hold myself accountable — but more than that, I want to show that change doesn’t have to wait for January 1st or a rock bottom. Sometimes, July 1st is enough.

If you’re ready to reset your life too, follow along here on the blog or over on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@aka.jimena). I’ll be posting honest updates, progress breakdowns, and hopefully a few wins along the way.

I'll also be sharing occassionally on [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@aka.jimena) & [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/aka.jimena). Let’s see what can happen in six months.

With love,
