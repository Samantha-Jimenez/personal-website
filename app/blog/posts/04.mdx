<span className="font-normal">I’ve decided to give myself six months to change my life,</span> and I’m bringing you along for the ride.

Starting <span className="font-normal">July 1st</span>, I’m launching a new YouTube vlog series called <em>6 Months to Change My Life</em>. Each month, I’ll document my journey across four pillars I’m focused on leveling up: <strong>Career, Fitness, Hobbies, and Aesthetics</strong>. The first two are more structured and goal-oriented, while the last two lean into creativity and self-discovery.

## The Four Pillars of My 6-Month Reset

### 1. Career

  <div className="flex-1">
    This is where I'm putting the most energy. I'm currently job hunting in tech and will be sharing the full experience from tracking applications and prepping for interviews to navigating rejection, imposter syndrome, and the mental side of staying consistent even when things feel slow. I'll also be working on a few personal projects to sharpen my skills and keep my creativity alive throughout the job search process.

### 2. Fitness — Body Recomp, Strength & Running
<div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row gap-4 sm:gap-8 items-start">
  <div className="flex-1">
    Last year, I lost 30 pounds and while I’m proud of that, I’ve now hit a plateau. That’s why my current focus is on body recomposition: building muscle while lowering body fat. I’ll be strength training, running outdoors, and trying new movement styles that bring me joy. I’m also committing to learning the splits, since I’ll be stretching more consistently while training.  

    Beyond workouts, I’ll be eating healthier, tracking macros, and aiming to close all my Apple Watch rings daily. That includes hitting 10,000 steps a day, staying active, and holding myself accountable through data and discipline.

### 3. Hobbies
<div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row gap-4 sm:gap-8 items-start">
  <div className="flex-1">
    At least four days a week, I’ll carve out 30+ minutes for hobbies like:
    - Reading  
    - Baking and cooking  
    - Crocheting  
    - Gardening  
    - Rollerblading & biking (bonus: it fits fitness too)  

    These small acts of creativity and presence will be essential for my mental health throughout this journey. This is my reminder that life isn’t just about productivity: it’s about joy, play, and being a whole human.

### 4. Aesthetics — Beauty, Style & Experimentation
<div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row gap-4 sm:gap-8 items-start">
  <div className="flex-1">
    Each week, I’ll style 3–4 pieces from my closet I’ve been neglecting like shoes, accessories, statement outfits I’ve been “saving for the right moment.” For context: most of my belongings were in storage for two years, and when I finally got everything back, I was 30 pounds heavier and couldn’t fit into most of it. That disconnection from my wardrobe left me feeling out of touch with my own style so now, I’m trying things on again with a fresh perspective and a bit more compassion.  

    I’ll also experiment with 2–3 new makeup or hair looks weekly to keep things fresh and fun. On the hair side: I have curly hair that was once very short, and now it’s the longest it’s ever been. Styling it takes real effort and honestly, sometimes it makes me want to chop it all off again. So part of this reset is learning how to care for and embrace it better, without the overwhelm.

## Why I’m Documenting This

I want to see if it’s possible to change my life in six months and I want to hold myself accountable. But I also hope to inspire someone else who might feel stuck or stagnant. We don’t need a new year or a rock bottom to start over. Sometimes, now is enough.

So, if you’re ready to reset your life too, follow along here on the blog or over on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@aka.jimena). I’ll be posting honest updates, progress breakdowns, and hopefully a few wins along the way.

I’ll also be sharing occasionally on [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@aka.jimena) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/aka.jimena). Let’s see what can happen in six months.

With love,
