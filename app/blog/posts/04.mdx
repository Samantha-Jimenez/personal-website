<span className="font-normal">I’ve decided to give myself six months to change my life,</span> and I’m bringing you along for the ride.

Starting <span className="font-normal">July 1st</span>, I’m launching a new YouTube vlog series called <em>6 Months to Change My Life</em>. Each month, I’ll document my journey across four pillars I’m focused on leveling up: <strong>Career, Fitness, Hobbies, and Aesthetics</strong>. The first two are more structured and goal-oriented, while the last two lean into creativity and self-discovery.

## The Four Pillars of My 6-Month Reset

### 1. Career
<div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row gap-4 sm:gap-8 items-start">
  <div className="flex-1">
    This is where I’m putting the most energy. I’m currently job hunting in tech and will be sharing the full experience from tracking applications and prepping for interviews to navigating rejection, imposter syndrome, and the mental side of staying consistent even when things feel slow.

### 2. Fitness — Body Recomp, Strength & Running
<div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row gap-4 sm:gap-8 items-start">
  <div className="flex-1">
    My goal is body recomposition. That means hitting the gym, strength training, running outside, and trying new movement styles that bring me joy. I’m also learning to do the splits.

### 3. Hobbies
<div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row gap-4 sm:gap-8 items-start">
  <div className="flex-1">
    At least four days a week, I’ll carve out 30+ minutes for hobbies like:
    - Reading
    - Baking and cooking
    - Crocheting
    - Gardening
    - Rollerblading & biking (bonus: it fits fitness too)
    
    This is my reminder that life isn’t just about productivity — it’s about being a full human.

### 4. Aesthetics — Beauty, Style & Experimentation
<div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row gap-4 sm:gap-8 items-start">
  <div className="flex-1">
    Each week, I’ll style 3–4 pieces from my closet I’ve been neglecting — shoes, accessories, statement outfits I’ve been “saving for the right moment.” I’ll also experiment with 2–3 new makeup or hair looks weekly to keep things fresh and fun.

## Why I’m Documenting This

I want to see if it's possible to change my life in 6 months and I want to hold myself accountable, sure — but I also want to inspire someone else who might feel stuck or stagnant. We don't need a new year or a rock bottom to start over. Sometimes, July 1st is enough.

So, if you’re ready to reset your life too, follow along here on the blog or over on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@aka.jimena). I’ll be posting honest updates, progress breakdowns, and hopefully a few wins along the way.

I'll also be sharing occassionally on [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@aka.jimena) & [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/aka.jimena). Let’s see what can happen in six months.

With love,
