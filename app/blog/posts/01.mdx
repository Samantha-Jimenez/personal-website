I’ve always had a complicated relationship with being perceived. The idea of people watching, forming opinions, *seeing* me—it used to make me want to shrink. And for a while, I did. I pulled back. I avoided. I isolated. 

But that version of me? She’s not who I want to be anymore. So here I am—starting this blog as a form of exposure therapy. This space is one of many ways I’m working through my fear of being perceived and finding freedom on the other side of it.

We’re entering a new season, a new quarter, and a new chapter of my life (my birthday just passed—shoutout to Aries season 🔥). Mercury’s still retrograde for a few more days, so I’m taking it slow, reflecting, and easing into this with grace. This isn’t about being perfect. It’s about showing up.

So why blog? Why now?

### 🧠 To get things off my chest and out of my mind

Some thoughts are too heavy to carry around all day. Writing them down helps me release the pressure. This blog is my digital diary, a safe space to let it all out.
Lately, I've been feeling like my brain is buzzing. I have so many ideas, there are so many things I want to do, and as opposed to nicheing down I want to talk about everything, to do everything, to just create and get the weight of these ideas off of my shoulders.

### 🫶🏽 To feel seen, heard, understood, and connected

I’m learning that I’m not alone in my overthinking, my introversion, or my desire to be bold even when I’m anxious. I want to connect with folks who feel the same—especially fellow creatives and introverts trying to figure it all out.

### 🌱 To build a community

This isn’t just about me talking into the void. I want this to become a place where stories are shared, where people feel understood, where we grow together. Whether you’re here to read, comment (eventually), or just lurk—I see you.

### 🎨 To unleash creativity

There’s a part of me that’s been waiting to be expressed. Blogging, for me, is one form of opening that door and letting her out. Expect some reflection, some vulnerability, some joy, and maybe some memes.

### 🌍 To take up space

After so much time avoiding and hiding, I’m ready to expand. To take up space. To be loud sometimes. To not apologize for being seen.

This blog is my gentle push forward. My creative mirror. My reminder that I can show up imperfectly and still be powerful.

Thanks for being here at the beginning. Let’s see where this goes.

With love,  
**Sammie**
