I haven’t always been afraid of being seen. Social anxiety crept in over the past five years, slowly reshaping how I move through the world. But deep down, I know that isn’t my true nature. As a triple fire sign, it’s in me to burn bright, take up space, and shine. Still, somewhere along the way, I pulled back. I avoided. I isolated. And that shrinking version of me? She’s not who I want to be anymore.

So here I am—starting this blog as a form of *exposure therapy*. This space is one of many ways I’m working through my fear of being perceived and finding freedom on the other side of it.

We’re entering a new season, a new quarter, and a new chapter of my life (my birthday just passed—shoutout to Aries season). Mercury’s still retrograde for a few more days, so I’m taking it slow, reflecting, and easing into this with grace. This isn’t about being perfect. It’s about showing up.

So why blog? Why now?

### To get things off my chest and out of my mind

Anxiety and overthinking have been weighing heavy on me lately. My mind has felt like it's constantly buzzing—with ideas, projects, dreams, and thoughts that don’t always have a place to land. This blog is my digital diary, a safe space to let it all out.
Instead of niching down, I want to explore it all—to talk about everything, do everything, and create freely. I just need to get the weight of these ideas off my shoulders.

### To feel seen, heard, understood, and connected

I’m learning that I’m not alone in my overthinking, my introversion, or my desire to be bold even when I’m anxious. I want to connect with folks who feel the same—especially fellow creatives and introverts trying to figure it all out.

### To build a community

This isn’t just about me talking into the void. I want this to become a place where stories are shared, where people feel understood, where we grow together. If anything here resonates with you, follow me on [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@aka.jimena) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/aka.jimena)—I’d love to connect beyond the blog.

### To unleash creativity

There’s a part of me that’s been waiting to be expressed. Blogging, for me, is one form of opening that door and letting her out. Expect some reflection, some vulnerability, some joy, and a little main character energy.

### To take up space

After so much time isolating, I’m ready to **expand**. To take up space. To be loud sometimes. To not apologize for being seen.

This blog is my gentle push forward. My creative mirror. A reminder that I don’t have to be perfect to be powerful—I just have to show up.

Thanks for being here at the beginning. Let’s see where this goes.

With love,
