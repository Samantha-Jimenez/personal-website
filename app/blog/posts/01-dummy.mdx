# Reigniting My Love for Coding Through Personal Projects

For a while, I felt burnt out.

What used to excite me about software—solving problems, building creative tools, experimenting with new ideas—started to feel like a chore. Deadlines, meetings, and high expectations took over the parts of coding that once felt like play.

But this year, I made a promise to myself: **build more for me.**

## Remembering the Why

I started coding because I loved making things from scratch. Whether it was a tiny animation, a silly website, or a helpful app, that spark came from seeing something I built come to life. Somewhere along the way, I lost that. So I'm getting it back—by focusing on:

- Passion projects over perfection
- Tools that help *me* in my daily life
- Websites and apps that reflect my personality and values

## Projects I'm Excited About

Here are a few personal projects I've kicked off recently:

- A digital garden-style blog built with Next.js
- A moodboard app to organize and visualize creative inspiration
- A photo-sharing site for my family with location filtering and private uploads

Nothing fancy, nothing overengineered. Just fun.

## Lessons Learned

What surprised me most? How quickly joy returned once the pressure was gone.

By giving myself space to explore and letting go of "best practices" for a moment, I've reconnected with the curious beginner I used to be. It's refreshing.

If you're feeling stuck or uninspired, I highly recommend going back to basics: build something weird, useful, or totally pointless—but make it yours.

Here's to creating with joy again.
