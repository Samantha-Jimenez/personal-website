<span className="font-normal">The Puerto Rican Day Parade hits different when the soundtrack is right.</span> Whether you're dancing on the streets, cooking with family, or blasting music from a rooftop, these songs bring all the energy, nostalgia, and heart that I need.

Here's what's been on repeat for me all weekend, in no particular order:

## 1. El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico ‚Äî *Brujer√≠a*

  <div className="flex-1">
    El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico is a given for this weekend. This legendary orchestra has been at the heart of Puerto Rican music since the 1960s. 
  
    *Brujer√≠a*, originally released in 1990, is a perfect mix of catchy melody, irresistible rhythm, and storytelling that's hard not to sing along with.
    What's beautiful about *Brujer√≠a* is how timeless it is. Even more so now, this past year it went viral on TikTok and Instagram, sparking a wave of dance challenges, edits, and nostalgic remixes. A new generation is discovering the magic of this track and turning it into a cultural moment all over again!

## 2. N.O.R.E ft. Nina Sky & Tego Calder√≥n ‚Äî *Oye Mi Canto*
<div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row gap-4 sm:gap-8 items-start">
  <div className="flex-1">
    This track was a cultural moment! When it dropped in the early 2000s, it was one of the first times I heard Puerto Rican identity, Afro Latino pride, and urban culture colliding in a way that felt natural and unapologetic. I honestly felt seen.
    There was some controversy around the versions‚Äîone featuring Daddy Yankee and the original with Tego Calder√≥n. Some preferred the Yankee version, but as a Puerto Rican, I was just grateful for the visibility and pride it brought to our community. Personally, the original version with Tego will always be my favorite.

    *Oye Mi Canto* still slaps today. Every time it comes on, I'm transported back to the era of block parties, oversized hoops, and deep-rooted Boricua pride.

## 3. Bad Bunny ‚Äî *Nuevayol*

    alt="Album art for Nuevayol by Bad Bunny"
    caption="A gritty, reflective track about Puerto Rican identity in NYC."
  />
  <div className="flex-1">
    *Nuevayol* is the song of the summer. Need I say more? Bad Bunny has had a massive impact on Puerto Rican culture across the diaspora, and this track is the epitome of that.

    What makes *Nuevayol* even more powerful is its sample of El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico‚Äîthe very same orchestra I mentioned earlier. That connection between generations is genius. It's a nod to our musical roots while telling a modern story of identity, migration, and pride. The sample bridges the past and present in a way that Bad Bunny has been mastering lately.

## 4. Plan B ‚Äî *Guatauba*
<div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row gap-4 sm:gap-8 items-start">
  <div className="flex-1">
    Throwback reggaet√≥n at its finest. This song was released during the early wave of underground reggaet√≥n. *Guatauba* helped define the perreo sound of the 2000s. I remember first hearing this song at a middle school party and <span className="underline decoration-gray-400">the nostalgia still hasn't faded</span>. This song brings me back to Jones Beach in the summer and bodegas in Bushwick. 

    Plan B's impact on the genre is undeniable. They helped carve out a space for reggaet√≥n to thrive long before it was mainstream. *Guatauba* is more than a party song; It's a time capsule.

## 5. H√©ctor Lavoe ‚Äî *Aguanile*

    alt="Classic album art for Aguanile by H√©ctor Lavoe"
    caption="Spiritual, soulful, and intensely powerful."
  />
  <div className="flex-1">
    *Aguanile* is pure magic. With its Afro-Caribbean roots and Lavoe's commanding voice, it's more than a song. It's a ritual.

    This track, performed with Willie Col√≥n, blends the powerful storytelling of salsa with Yoruba-influenced chants and Santer√≠a references, creating a spiritual and sonic experience that feels ancestral.

    What makes *Aguanile* so enduring is its emotional intensity. Whether you're in a club, a kitchen, or a car, this song stops you in your tracks. It literally gives me goosebumps when it comes on.
