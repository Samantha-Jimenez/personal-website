The Puerto Rican Day Parade hits different when the soundtrack is right. Whether you're dancing on the streets, cooking with family, or blasting music from a rooftop, these songs bring all the energy, nostalgia, and flavor I need.

Here's what's been on repeat for me all weekend, in no particular order:

## 1. El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico — *Brujería*

  <div className="flex-1">
    You can't go wrong with El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico. This legendary orchestra has been at the heart of Puerto Rican music since the 1960s. 
  
    *Brujería*, originally released in 1990, is a perfect mix of catchy melody, irresistible rhythm, and storytelling that's hard not to sing along with.
    What's beautiful about *Brujería* is how timeless it is. Even more so now, this past year it went viral on TikTok and Instagram, sparking a wave of dance challenges, edits, and nostalgic remixes. A new generation is discovering the magic of this track and turning it into a cultural moment all over again!

## 2. N.O.R.E ft. Nina Sky & Tego Calderón — *Oye Mi Canto*
<div className="flex gap-8 items-start">
  <div className="flex-1">
    This track was a cultural moment. When it dropped in the early 2000s, it was one of the first times I heard Puerto Rican identity, Black Latinx pride, and urban culture colliding in a way that felt mainstream and unapologetic.
    There was some controversy around the versions—one featuring Daddy Yankee and the original with Tego Calderón. Some preferred the Yankee version, but as a Puerto Rican, I was just grateful for the visibility and pride it brought to our community. Personally, the original version with Tego will always be my favorite.

    *Oye Mi Canto* still slaps today. Every time it comes on, I'm transported back to the era of block parties, oversized hoops, and deep-rooted Boricua pride.

## 3. Bad Bunny — *Nuevayol*

    alt="Album art for Nuevayol by Bad Bunny"
    caption="A gritty, reflective track about Puerto Rican identity in NYC."
  />
  <div className="flex-1">
    *Nuevayol* is raw and honest. It captures the Nuyorican energy I've seen and felt growing up. Bad Bunny has had a massive impact on Puerto Rican culture across the diaspora, and this track is a perfect example of that.

    What makes *Nuevayol* even more powerful is its sample of El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico—the very same orchestra I mentioned earlier. That connection between generations is genius. It's a nod to our musical roots while telling a modern story of identity, migration, and pride. The sample bridges the past and present in a way that Bad Bunny has been mastering lately.

## 4. Plan B — *Guatauba*
<div className="flex gap-8 items-start">
  <div className="flex-1">
    Throwback reggaetón at its finest. Plan B always knew how to get the party going, and *Guatauba* is a guaranteed dance floor filler.

    Released during the early wave of underground reggaetón, *Guatauba* was one of those raw, infectious tracks that helped define the perreo sound of the 2000s. It's gritty, it's sexy, and it doesn't hold back. That's exactly why it still bangs today.

    Plan B's impact on the genre is undeniable. They helped carve out a space for reggaetón to thrive long before it was mainstream, giving voice to barrio stories and creating beats that made people move. *Guatauba* is more than a party song. It's a time capsule of reggaetón's rebellious roots.

## 5. Héctor Lavoe — *Aguanile*
<div className="flex gap-8 items-start">

    width={120}
    height={180}
    className="w-1/3 h-auto m-0"  
    alt="Classic album art for Aguanile by Héctor Lavoe"
    caption="Spiritual, soulful, and intensely powerful."
  />
  <div className="flex-1">
    *Aguanile* is pure magic. With its Afro-Caribbean roots and Lavoe's commanding voice, it's more than a song. It's a ritual.

    This track, performed with Willie Colón, blends the powerful storytelling of salsa with Yoruba-influenced chants and Santería references, creating a spiritual and sonic experience that feels ancestral. It's defiant, heavy, and liberating all at once.

    What makes *Aguanile* so enduring is its emotional intensity. Lavoe's voice doesn't just sing, it pleads, it demands, it reverberates. Whether you're in a club, a kitchen, or a car, this song stops you in your tracks. This song always gives me goosebumps.

    For many of us in the diaspora, *Aguanile* connects us to something deeper: our history, our rhythm, and our resilience.
