April feels like a reset—a soft launch into the version of myself that’s more intentional, more curious, and more creatively awake. So it’s only right that this month’s reading list hits all those notes.

Here’s what’s been fueling my mind and creativity this month:

### *The Artist’s Way* by Julia Cameron  

This one has been on my list forever. *The Artist’s Way* is basically a classic for anyone trying to reclaim their creativity. Julia Cameron takes you on a 12-week journey of “creative recovery”—with daily morning pages, artist dates, and some gentle but deep soul-searching. I’m moving through it with patience, trusting the process to do its thing. If you’re feeling blocked, doubtful, or like you’ve been shrinking your ideas, this might just be the creative reboot you need.

### *The Great Divide* by Christina Henríquez

As a Panamanian girl, I had to read this. *The Great Divide* is a powerful historical novel about the building of the Panama Canal, told through the lives of several characters whose paths cross in unexpected ways. It centers love, migration, survival, and resistance. Henríquez’s storytelling is full of heart, and I’m ready to learn and reflect.

### *Make Time* by Jake Knapp & John Zeratsky

This book is helping me rethink how I approach my days. *Make Time* isn’t about hustle—it’s about focus. The authors share simple strategies for designing your time with intention (and letting go of the always-on, always-scrolling trap). It’s written in a way that’s super digestible and low-pressure, which I love. I’m already tweaking a few of my habits, and it’s wild how small shifts can add up.

### Why These Books?
Each of these speaks to a different part of me:
- **The dreamer/creative** (*The Artist’s Way*)
- **The cultural storyteller** (*The Great Divide*)
- **The structure-seeker** (*Make Time*)

I’ll probably share some reflections as I move through them—maybe even build a little ritual around reading every morning or evening. If you’ve read any of these, or have a favorite you’re loving right now, I’d love to hear from you.

Until next time,
