A bit about me... I’ve been coding since 2019 and working in the tech industry since 2020. I previously built user-facing experiences at a globally recognized fitness tech company, and over the years, I’ve developed a range of projects from community tools and fitness platforms to creative media apps.

AI used to feel like a distant future. Now it's everywhere; coding alongside us, remixing voices in music studios, generating art, writing scripts, and even animating full scenes. What once sounded like sci-fi is now speeding toward us with real consequences.

And the speed? Unnerving.

## The Fear Is Real: Layoffs, Uncertainty, and "What's Next?"

We’ve seen massive layoffs across the tech industry. Roles we once thought were safe suddenly aren’t. And with AI getting better at writing code, some engineers, myself included, are asking the uncomfortable question: <span className="italic font-medium">“Is software engineering a dying career?”</span>

There’s a lot of noise online — some optimistic, some apocalyptic. And honestly, depending on the day, I’ve felt both.

I’m not going to sugarcoat it: traditional software engineering roles aren’t going to look the same in a few years. Some of the jobs we were trained for are shrinking or shifting. But that doesn’t mean tech is dead; it means it's evolving.

## It’s Not Just Tech Anymore

At first, the conversation was all about code. GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and Replit Ghostwriter became everyday tools for engineers. But now, AI is moving far beyond dev tools.

Designers are seeing AI create logo variations in seconds. Animators are watching models replicate motion capture without the motion. Even music has entered the conversation. Timbaland recently debuted an AI-generated artist, and it’s… unsettling.

This isn’t about AI _assisting_ anymore, it’s starting to _replace_.

## Even the Arts Are on the Line

What’s especially wild (and honestly, a little gutting) is seeing AI creep into spaces that were once thought of as “safe” from automation. Graphic design. Illustration. Animation. Audio engineering. These aren’t just jobs, these are identities. Cultural contributions. Careers built over years of training and inspiration.

Now, some of that work is being commodified by prompts and trained models. And people, especially younger creatives and freelancers, are wondering what it all means for them.

## Engineers Aren’t Being Replaced, But We Are Being Challenged

Yes, AI can code. AI tools like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and Cursor are amazing at suggesting syntax, fixing bugs, and even generating entire components, but they still don’t understand the context behind _why_ we build. It still can’t read the room, manage edge cases with nuance, or architect clean systems across complex orgs. That’s still on us. And that’s our edge... for now. But even that edge feels like it's shrinking.

The best engineers right now are the ones adapting: learning how AI models are trained, experimenting with integrations, staying in community, and sharpening what can’t be easily automated: empathy, creativity, clarity. They’re learning how to use these tools to go faster and dream bigger. It’s not about being replaced, it’s about being <span className="font-medium">redefined</span>.

## Entrepreneurship Is Calling, Although Not for Everyone

I'm seeing more people in tech pivot into entrepreneurship. Some are launching newsletters or YouTube channels, going down the path of content creation, but others are building products, offering services, freelancing, consulting, and experimenting with business models that never would’ve been possible without AI.

The tools are faster. The cost to prototype is lower. The barrier to launch has never been thinner.

If you’ve got an idea, AI might just be the thing that helps you go from concept to company in a fraction of the time. That’s powerful. And a lot of tech folks are realizing that the real opportunity right now isn’t in job stability but rather in building something of your own.

That said, entrepreneurship isn’t for everyone. It comes with risk, burnout potential, and a whole lot of uncertainty. Some people thrive in structure, some don’t want to be “founders”, and that’s okay. You don’t have to be a brand or a business to navigate this shift meaningfully.

What matters most is figuring out what feels true to _you_ in this new landscape, then taking steps that align with that.

## My Honest Take: Cautious, Curious, and Consistent

Personally? I’m staying grounded but flexible. I’m learning what I can, experimenting when I can, and giving myself grace in the process.

I won’t lie. Some days this shift feels exciting. Most days it feels existential, like we’re all in a race no one signed up for but have no choice but to run.

Right now, I’m actively job hunting, but I’m also staying open. Open to pivoting if the right opportunity comes along. Open to going back to school or doing a focused program if it makes me more marketable. I don’t feel like I need to have it all figured out, but I do want to stay ready for whatever’s next.

This isn’t about blindly chasing every trend. It’s about staying aware, adaptable, and aligned with what feels true for me in this moment.

## My Plan Moving Forward: Adjust, Adapt, Don’t Get Left Behind

Here’s what I’m doing (because freezing isn’t an option):

- Actively applying to jobs and continuing interviews
- Studying and learning new languages, like Python
- Building projects I’m excited about and that I believe others will find useful
- Exploring AI and creativity intersections; especially in coding, design, and media
- Staying in community with other engineers to stay grounded
- Keeping my eyes open for opportunities that feel fulfilling

I’m doing what I can to stay sharp, stay engaged, and stay open. Whether it’s through education, exploration, or execution, I’m betting on momentum, not perfection. I don’t know exactly where this path leads yet, but I’m moving with purpose and curiosity.

No matter what happens next, I want to be ready, not rigid. The future of engineering isn’t about pretending AI doesn’t matter. It’s about embracing what’s possible _and_ being clear about the value we still bring.

Here’s what I’ll leave you with:
<span className="font-medium italic"> This is a moment of massive change. But also massive opportunity for those who are willing to evolve.</span>

Stay curious. Stay adaptable. Keep showing up.
